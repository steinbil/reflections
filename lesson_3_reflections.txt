When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    To backup, to collaborate, to share with other computers

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    To keep from sharing the code until you're ready

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks: clone a repo on github and link to original repo
    Clone: make a copy of a repo
    Branch: A sequential line of commits

    Use forks to make your own version of others repos and keep linking to them - possibly to suggest changes back
    Use clones to make a copy of a repo
    Use branches to try out new features etc. separate from master

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    To be able to compare your branch with the last known origin without internet connection and to be able to solve conflicts in that state

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Everything would harder, unless using a similar service

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
